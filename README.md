# VisuaLearn Project

## Overview
VisuaLearn revolutionizes traditional teaching methods by integrating artificial reality (AR) technology to provide students with a more immersive and effective learning experience. The platform offers functionalities such as user registration, virtual classes, laboratory experiments, and virtual field trips to enhance education through AR.

## Design Goals
- **Performance**: User inputs receive feedback within 1 second; complex interactions complete within 3 seconds.
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface with high-contrast, color-blind friendly palettes, and clear labels.
- **Security**: Encryption for all user data using AES-256, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantee.
- **Scalability**: Elastic cloud resources to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

## System Models
### Class Diagrams
Provide detailed structure and relationships of system classes.

### Sequence Diagrams
Illustrate interactions between system components over time.

### Activity Diagrams
Depict workflow of system processes.

### Statechart Diagrams
Show state transitions of system entities.

## Subsystem Decomposition
Detail how the system is divided into subsystems and their interactions.

## Hardware / Software Mapping
Outline the hardware and software requirements and their interactions.

## Other Design Concerns
### Concurrency
Transactions other than course registration can be done simultaneously, with conflict checks during registration.

### Data Management
Discuss data storage, retrieval, and management mechanisms.

### Global Resource Handling
Provide an access matrix based on actors and use cases.

### Boundary Conditions
Discuss initialization, termination, and failure recovery procedures.
